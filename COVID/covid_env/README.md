# Dashboard

This project uses 3D Labs and Pandas to create dashboards based on JSON files.

To execute the project you must run ``python manage.py runserver`` and then enter http://127.0.0.1:8000/covid_app/dashboard/.

Every dashboard has its own file and they can be found in covid_env/data/ folder:

1. Scatter Chart uses scatter_data.json
2. Pie Chart uses pie_data.json
3. Area Chart uses area_data.json
4. Bar Chart uses bar_data.json
